defmodule Arcana.Loop.Tools do
  @moduledoc """
  Default tool definitions and execution for `Arcana.Loop`.

  Tools are exposed to the controller LLM as `ReqLLM.Tool` structs. The
  callbacks on those structs are placeholders: the loop runner executes
  tools itself via `execute/4` so it can mutate the loop state (accumulate
  chunks, record history, terminate the loop).

  ## Default toolset

  | Tool      | What it does                                                |
  |-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `search`  | Search the knowledge base. Uses graph data when available. |
  | `answer`  | Provide the final answer (terminates the loop).            |
  | `give_up` | Admit defeat and stop (terminates the loop).               |

  Terminating tools (`answer` and `give_up`) end the loop. `search` is the
  only tool that touches your Repo and the only one that accumulates state.

  Query rewriting and decomposition aren't separate tools — they happen
  inside the `search` tool's `query` parameter, guided by the system prompt.

  To customize, pass `tools: [...]` to `Loop.run/2` with your own list of
  `ReqLLM.Tool` structs. Custom tools that mutate loop state need a matching
  clause in `execute/4`.
